## Data Inbox code test

This is my version of the design/documentation provided. I haven't used the new Redux Toolkit, so that was fun and hope I did it correctly.
I also found testing difficult given the lack of a submit button for inputs, was trickier figuring that out.
Validation occurs onBlur for the input events, and I added the feature of Selecting All for removal.

Open to any constructive feedback, thanks!
